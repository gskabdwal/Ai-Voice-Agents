🎙️ **Day 3/10: Built a Health & Wellness Voice Companion!** 🧘‍♀️

Today's challenge was all about creating a supportive AI companion that actually remembers past conversations. Not just another chatbot – this is a wellness companion that builds continuity over time.

**What I Built:**
✅ Voice-based daily check-ins for mood, energy, and goals
✅ JSON persistence layer that saves every conversation
✅ Memory system that references past check-ins naturally
✅ Function tools for structured data collection
✅ Supportive, grounded advice (no medical claims!)

**Technical Highlights:**
- Built with LiveKit Agents framework
- Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for natural conversations
- Voice synthesis by **Murf Falcon** – seriously the fastest TTS API I've used! ⚡
- Deepgram for speech recognition
- Custom function tools for wellness data management

**The Cool Part:**
When you return for a second check-in, the agent doesn't just start fresh. It says things like: *"Last time you mentioned being stressed about work deadlines. How does today compare?"*

This kind of continuity is what makes voice AI feel truly personal and useful.

**What's Next:**
Could extend this with MCP integrations to create tasks in Todoist or Notion, weekly reflection analytics, and more. The foundation is solid!

Proud to be part of the **Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge** 🚀
